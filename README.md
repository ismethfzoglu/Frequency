# Frequency
This Python code analyzes a given sentence to determine the frequency of each character. It then prints out the characters along with the number of times they appear in the sentence.
This Python code snippet analyzes the frequency of each character in a given sentence. It utilizes a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each character.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

encoding = "utf-8-": This line defines a variable named encoding and assigns it the value "utf-8-". However, it seems that there might be a typo or an incomplete string.

sentence = "ProgramlamaÖdeviİleriSeviyeVeriYapılarıveObjeleripynb": This line creates a variable named sentence and assigns it a string containing a sequence of characters. This is the input sentence that will be analyzed for character frequencies.

def frequency():: This line starts the definition of a function named frequency. Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. In this case, the function is going to analyze the frequency of characters in the sentence.

words = dict(): Inside the frequency function, a dictionary named words is initialized. This dictionary will be used to store the frequency of each character.

for i in sentence:: This line starts a loop that iterates through each character (i) in the sentence.

if i in words:: This line checks if the current character i is already a key in the words dictionary.

If i is already a key in words, it means it has been encountered before, so the code increments its count by 1.
If i is not in words, it means it's the first time encountering it, so a new entry is created with a count of 1.
for i, j in words.items():: After all characters have been processed, this line initiates another loop to iterate through the items (key-value pairs) in the words dictionary.

print("{} : {} times mentioned in the sentence".format(i,j)): Within the loop, this line prints the character (i) and its corresponding count (j) in the format "character : count times mentioned in the sentence".

frequency(): Finally, this line calls the frequency function, triggering the execution of all the code inside it.

Execution:

When the code is executed, it will analyze the provided sentence and print out the frequency of each character.

Note: The code might throw an error due to the typo in encoding = "utf-8-". It seems like there's a missing or incorrect string. If you intended to use a specific encoding, please correct it.
